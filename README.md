# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.  
It is my **first complete coding project** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, created to document my academic journey, projects, achievements, and professional connections.

The website is fully responsive, performance-focused, and written from scratch with no frameworks, allowing me to understand the fundamentals of front-end web development deeply.

---

## Overview

The portfolio is designed as a single-page website with smooth navigation and structured sections, including:

- Landing introduction with typing animation  
- Achievements and competitions showcase  
- Academic and university projects  
- Personal and professional connections  
- Contact and social links  

The goal of this project was not only to build a portfolio, but to **learn how modern websites are structured, styled, and made interactive using vanilla web technologies**.

## Tech Stack & Libraries

**Core Technologies**
- HTML5 — semantic structure and accessibility
- CSS3 — layout, animations, responsiveness
- JavaScript (ES6) — interactivity and DOM manipulation

**External Libraries & Assets**
- Google Fonts (Poppins)
- Font Awesome 6.5.2 (icons)
- No CSS or JS frameworks were used

This project intentionally avoids frameworks to reinforce core concepts such as layout systems, responsive design, and event-driven JavaScript.

## Project Structure
`index.html`
Main HTML file containing the full structure of the website.

`style.css`
Primary stylesheet defining layout, typography, color system, and animations.

`mediaqueries.css`
Responsive styling rules for tablet and mobile breakpoints.

`script.js`

## Learning Journey & Credits

This project marks my **first serious step into web development**, built entirely from scratch while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.

I learned and referenced step-by-step guidance from the following creators, whose tutorials provided an excellent foundation:

- **Pro Coder**  
  *Create A Portfolio Website Using HTML and CSS Only*

- **How to Become a Developer**  
  *Responsive Portfolio Website From Scratch*  
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU

Their tutorials helped me understand layout structure, styling logic, and responsive thinking.  
With additional experimentation and light assistance from ChatGPT, I personalized the design, extended the functionality, and adapted the code into my own version.

This project represents learning by doing, including trial, error, and iteration, and serves as a strong foundation and interest for my future development work.
